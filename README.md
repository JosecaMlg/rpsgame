# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

This is a simple application wich plays automatic rounds of the popular game rock paper scissors.

It's a really simple approach. 

There are 2 kinds of player.
Player 1 always chose Rock in the game, and player 2 always chose a random shape (Rock, Paper, Scissors).

This Application is an web application runing over Spring boot 2.4.3 and JavaSE-11. Is also documented in Swagger (OpenApi).

Here I'll show 2 ways to execute the APP:

- In the root of the project run in a terminal the following ...
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Inside the Spring tool Suite IDE
